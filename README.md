Inspired by the many atrocious messages I receive on a daily bases on dating sites, I decided to do something with it. Meet: Your new boyfriend. He's a Twitter bot, actually, a Twitter bot created by me to generate messages based on what women have received from all too excited men on the internet. Some of the messages in here are perfectly fine - some are crude, gross, and disgusting. All names mentioned have been changed.

All the code here is done by me, with some help in the source messages from anonymous folks. Please don't just, y'know, steal the code and make your own bot with it, which, I mean, you could technically do.

So, what does it do? Essentially, it just mashes two sentences up together a set number of times based on the frequency of words. It's going to do more in the future though, I promise!

If it wasn't clear: source_messages.py is intentionally being kept private, and I've hidden the keys consumer/access keys for the twitter bot because, well, I don't want you meddling kids in on it.

You can see the results at @DatingSiteDream on Twitter.

This bot is still a work in process - there's a few things that need to be done. Firstly, the sample is currently about 230 messages: that's not nearly enough. I need many more. If you are a woman receiving messages that you want to submit, and you'd be willing to help out by submitting some of the messages you receive, please throw me a message at @hoeyboey on Twitter.

The actual procedural generation needs work - this is currently what you might consider a prototype. As I don't have nearly the numbers for some sort of neural network tomfoolery, it's a...weird system, that I'm constantly building on. 

And a few other things, that are very much in the "I need to research if this is actually possible" realm of things. Maybe they'll happen someday.
